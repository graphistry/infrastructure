# Graphistry Infrastructure

We are excited to share our infrastructure automation, and hope that it will be useful to you.

We are enthusiastic about artifact-based workflows, and our artifacts are Docker containers that run our GPU code.

This repository currently has how we initialize a box to hold containers that run GPU code. More soon.
